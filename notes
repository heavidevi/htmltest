**PASS BY REFERENCE VS PASS BY VALUE**
pass by reference only takes the address of the the key not the address of the value so it depends on the case weather the object copied
if the object in non-primitive object is changed the addres of value doesn't change
hence making the value different and making it more 

// console.log(user1.name1,user2,user2.ispakistani)

object1=[1,2,3,4]
object2=object1

object1[2]=4
// console.log(object2,object1)
{{{output : [1,2,4,4][1,2,4,4}}}
o1={name:"ali",age:12}
o2=o1
o1.name="ahmmed"
console.log(o1)
console.log(o2)
{{{output : o1:{testing}
  o2:{ali,12}  }}}

nameageobejct={name:"ali",age:13}
//using spread operator for cloning 
nameAgeEmail={...nameageobejct,email:"123@outlookl.com"}  //p  js ka featue hai of "..." for cloning and making it pass by value
nameAgeEmail.name="123"
console.log(nameAgeEmail,nameageobejct)

OUTPUT{{{{ name: '123', age: 13, email: '123@outlookl.com' } { name: 'ali', age: 13 }   }}}
